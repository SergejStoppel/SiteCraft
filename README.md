### üéØ Quick Start Guide

1. **Review Architecture**: Start with `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand the overall system design
2. **Choose Your Track**: 
   - Backend developers: Follow `backend-epics.md`
   - Frontend developers: Follow `frontend-epics.md`
3. **Follow the Process**: Use `completion-guide.md` for ticket management

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- **Background Jobs**: Bull Queue with Redis

### Frontend

- **Forms**: React Hook Form
- **UI Components**: Headless UI + Custom components

## Development Priorities

### Critical Path (Start Here)
1. **Backend Setup** (BE-001) - Project foundation
2. **Authentication** (BE-002) - User management
3. **Website Audit Engine** (BE-003) - Core functionality
4. **Content Generation** (BE-004) - AI-powered features
5. **Payment System** (BE-005) - Subscription management
6. **Frontend Setup** (FE-001) - UI foundation including global styles
7. **Landing Page** (FE-002) - User acquisition
8. **Dashboard** (FE-004) - User interface

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Frontend landing page can be built while backend is in development
- SEO and Accessibility analyzers can be developed in parallel
- Content generation can be built alongside audit features
- Payment system can be developed in parallel with audit and content features
- Global style guide ensures consistent UI development across all components
