# Website Accessibility Compliance Implementation Breakdown

This document outlines the features we can offer for Website Accessibility Compliance, distinguishing between those achievable by scanning a website (without code access) and those requiring direct access to the website's code.

## 1. Features Achievable by Scanning Websites (Without Code Access)

These features focus on identifying accessibility issues through automated scans of publicly available website content. They are valuable for initial assessments, generating reports, and providing actionable recommendations to clients.

### 1.1. Automated Accessibility Audits & Reporting

*   **Feature:** Automatically scan web pages for common accessibility violations against standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
*   **Details:**
    *   **Identification of Issues:** Detect missing alternative text for images, insufficient color contrast, missing form labels, improper heading structures, non-descriptive link text, keyboard navigation issues (limited to what's detectable via automated tools).
    *   **Severity Classification:** Categorize identified issues by their impact on users with disabilities (e.g., critical, serious, moderate).
    *   **Summary Feedback:** Provide immediate, high-level feedback on the website's overall accessibility status upon scan completion.
    *   **Detailed Reports:** Generate comprehensive reports that list specific accessibility violations, their location on the page, and general explanations of why they are issues. These reports can serve as a roadmap for remediation.

### 1.2. AI-Driven Accessibility Suggestions (Conceptual)

*   **Feature:** Leverage AI to suggest potential improvements or fixes for identified accessibility issues, even without direct code access.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Alt Text Suggestions:** For images missing alt text, AI can analyze the image content and generate descriptive alternative text suggestions for the client to implement.
    *   **Color Contrast Recommendations:** If color contrast issues are detected, AI can suggest alternative color combinations that meet WCAG contrast ratios.
    *   **Link Text Improvement Ideas:** For generic link text (e.g., 


"click here"), AI can suggest more descriptive alternatives based on surrounding content.
    *   **Heading Structure Recommendations:** Analyze the page content and suggest a more logical and hierarchical heading structure.

### 1.3. Automated Website Mockups & Design Suggestions (Accessibility-Focused)

*   **Feature:** Generate visual mockups of a website incorporating accessibility best practices, demonstrating potential improvements without altering the live site.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Accessible Template Application:** Apply accessible design templates to the client's existing content, showcasing how their site could look with improved color schemes, font sizes, and layout for better accessibility.
    *   **AI-Enhanced Visuals:** Demonstrate how AI could generate accessible versions of images (e.g., with clear focus indicators) or suggest accessible design patterns.

### 1.4. Continuous Monitoring & Alerting

*   **Feature:** Periodically rescan client websites to detect new accessibility issues that may arise from content updates or design changes.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Scheduled Scans:** Automate daily, weekly, or monthly scans of client websites.
    *   **Issue Change Detection:** Identify new or resolved accessibility issues between scans.
    *   **Automated Notifications:** Send alerts to clients when new critical accessibility issues are detected, prompting them to take action.

## 2. Features Requiring Website Code Access

These features involve direct modification of the website's underlying code or content management system (CMS). They allow for comprehensive remediation of accessibility issues and proactive implementation of accessible design principles.

### 2.1. Direct Remediation of Accessibility Issues

*   **Feature:** Directly implement code changes to fix identified accessibility violations.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Semantic HTML Implementation:** Ensure proper use of HTML5 semantic elements (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) to improve document structure for assistive technologies.
    *   **ARIA Attributes:** Add appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to dynamic content, custom widgets, and interactive elements to convey roles, states, and properties to screen readers.
    *   **Keyboard Navigation Enhancements:** Implement robust keyboard navigation, ensuring all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard alone, with clear focus indicators.
    *   **Form Accessibility:** Ensure all form fields have explicit labels, proper error handling, and clear instructions for users with disabilities.
    *   **Image Alt Text Implementation:** Directly add descriptive `alt` attributes to all meaningful images.
    *   **Color Contrast Correction:** Adjust CSS to ensure sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
    *   **Video/Audio Accessibility:** Implement captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions for multimedia content.

### 2.2. Proactive Accessible Design & Development

*   **Feature:** Build or rebuild websites from the ground up with accessibility as a core principle, rather than an afterthought.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Accessible Template Development:** Create custom, fully accessible website templates that meet WCAG standards by design.
    *   **Inclusive UI/UX Design:** Incorporate inclusive design principles from the initial design phase, considering diverse user needs.
    *   **JavaScript Accessibility:** Ensure all dynamic content and interactive elements built with JavaScript are accessible to assistive technologies.
    *   **Content Management System (CMS) Integration:** Configure CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Drupal) with accessibility-focused themes and plugins, and train clients on creating accessible content within the CMS.

### 2.3. Ongoing Accessibility Maintenance & Updates

*   **Feature:** Provide continuous maintenance and updates to ensure the website remains accessible as content changes, new features are added, or accessibility standards evolve.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Code Reviews for Accessibility:** Conduct regular code reviews to ensure new features or content updates do not introduce accessibility barriers.
    *   **Automated Testing Integration:** Integrate automated accessibility testing into the development and deployment pipeline to catch issues before they go live.
    *   **Manual Accessibility Testing:** Perform periodic manual testing with assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) and diverse users to identify issues that automated tools might miss.
    *   **Accessibility Training:** Provide training to client content creators and developers on best practices for maintaining an accessible website.

This tiered approach allows us to engage with clients at various levels of commitment and technical access, providing valuable accessibility solutions tailored to their specific needs.
