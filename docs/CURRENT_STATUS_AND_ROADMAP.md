## 📋 **Migration Notes**

### **Regarding sprint2-architecture.md:**
The `docs/sprint2-architecture.md` file is now **outdated** and should be **archived or removed** because:

1. **Scope Changed**: Original Sprint 2 was about tabular displays, but we've expanded to full report restructuring
2. **PDF Removal**: The architecture assumed PDF generation, which we've eliminated
3. **AI Integration**: The original plan didn't include AI-powered insights
4. **SEO Addition**: The new plan includes SEO analysis not covered in Sprint 2

### **Replaced By:**
- `docs/detailed-report-enhancement-plan.md` - Complete new architecture
- This updated roadmap document

**Recommendation:** Archive `sprint2-architecture.md` to `docs/archive/` folder.

**Ready for Phase 1 implementation!** 🚀
