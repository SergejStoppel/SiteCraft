# Website Plan: Structure and User Flow

This document outlines the proposed page structure and user flow for our small business online presence solution website. The goal is to create an intuitive, informative, and conversion-focused experience for potential clients.

## 1. Website Page Structure

Our website will be structured to guide visitors through understanding their pain points, discovering our solutions, and ultimately converting into clients. The core pages will include:

*   **Home Page (`/`):** The entry point for most visitors, providing an overview of our services and immediate value proposition.
*   **Services Page (`/services`):** A detailed breakdown of our tiered offerings, distinguishing between services without and with website code access.
    *   **Accessibility Compliance Page (`/services/accessibility`):** Dedicated page for our AI-powered accessibility assessment and remediation services.
    *   **SEO & Content Page (`/services/seo-content`):** Dedicated page for our AI-driven SEO and content idea generation services.
    *   **Website Overhaul Page (`/services/website-overhaul`):** Dedicated page for our website redesign and technical implementation services.
*   **Pricing Page (`/pricing`):** A clear and transparent presentation of our subscription plans and one-time service costs.
*   **About Us Page (`/about`):** Information about our mission, values, and team, building trust and credibility.
*   **Case Studies/Portfolio Page (`/case-studies` or `/portfolio`):** Showcasing successful client projects and measurable results.
*   **Blog (`/blog`):** A content hub for articles on web accessibility, SEO best practices, digital marketing trends, and small business success stories. This will be crucial for organic traffic and establishing expertise.
*   **Contact Us Page (`/contact`):** Multiple ways for potential clients to get in touch, including a contact form, phone number, and email.
*   **Free Tools/Audit Page (`/free-audit` or `/tools`):** A prominent page for the free accessibility scan and other potential free tools, serving as a lead magnet.
*   **Login/Client Portal (`/login` or `/client-portal`):** For existing clients to access their dashboards, reports, and manage their services.

## 2. User Flow

The primary user flows are designed to convert visitors into leads and then into paying clients. We will also consider flows for existing clients.

### 2.1. New Visitor Flow (Lead Generation & Conversion)

1.  **Discovery:** A potential client discovers our website through search engines (organic or paid), social media, or direct outreach.
2.  **Initial Engagement (Home Page):** The user lands on the Home Page. They are immediately presented with the core problem we solve (online presence challenges for small businesses) and our overarching solution. A prominent Call-to-Action (CTA) will be for the 


free accessibility scan or a general inquiry.
3.  **Problem Identification & Solution Exploration (Free Audit/Services Pages):**
    *   If the user clicks on the free audit CTA, they are directed to the Free Tools/Audit Page where they can submit their website URL for an instant, high-level accessibility check. This provides immediate value and demonstrates our capabilities.
    *   If the user is exploring, they might navigate to the Services Page to understand our offerings in more detail. From there, they can drill down into specific service pages (Accessibility, SEO & Content, Website Overhaul) to learn about features, benefits, and how each service addresses their pain points.
4.  **Value Proposition Reinforcement (Case Studies/Blog):** As the user explores, they might visit the Case Studies/Portfolio Page to see real-world examples of our success and the measurable impact we've had on other businesses. The Blog will offer valuable insights and establish our expertise, building trust and credibility.
5.  **Pricing & Commitment (Pricing Page):** Once the user understands the value, they will likely visit the Pricing Page to see the investment required. This page will clearly outline our tiered subscription models and one-time service options, distinguishing between services that do and do not require website code access. Clear justification for subscription value will be present here.
6.  **Conversion (Contact Us / Sign-up):**
    *   For Tier 1 services (without code access), the user can directly sign up for a subscription or purchase a one-time report/idea pack.
    *   For Tier 2 services (requiring code access) or if they have specific questions, the user will be encouraged to fill out a contact form on the Contact Us Page, schedule a consultation, or call us directly. This initiates a sales conversation.

### 2.2. Existing Client Flow

1.  **Login:** Existing clients will access their dedicated Client Portal via the Login link.
2.  **Dashboard Access:** Upon logging in, clients will see a personalized dashboard displaying their service status, recent reports (e.g., accessibility scan results, SEO audit summaries), and key performance metrics.
3.  **Service Management:** Clients can request changes, upload new content (for content services), update business information, or access support resources through the portal.
4.  **Reporting & Analytics:** The portal will provide access to detailed reports and analytics related to their services (e.g., accessibility compliance progress, SEO ranking improvements, website performance).

This structured user flow ensures that both prospective and existing clients can easily navigate the website to find the information they need and interact with our services effectively.
