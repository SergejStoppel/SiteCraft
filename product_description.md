Business Overview: SiteCraftStudio
Pain Point
Small businesses lack the time, expertise, and budget to maintain a compliant, optimized, and engaging online presence. This results in lost traffic, poor search visibility, legal exposure due to inaccessibility, and outdated or underperforming websites.

Value Proposition
An AI-powered subscription service offering:

Instant accessibility audits.

SEO optimization and content generation tailored to niche and location.

Automated website redesign mockups and full implementation services.
All under one roof—affordable, automated, and tailored for non-technical local business owners.

Timeliness
Growing legal enforcement of web accessibility (ADA, WCAG).

Post-COVID digital presence is now mission-critical.

AI adoption is booming and enabling cost-effective automation of SEO, design, and content.

Market Gap
Most SEO tools are too complex for small business owners.

Accessibility compliance tools are enterprise-focused.

Agencies charge too much or don’t scale well for smaller clients.
This solution targets the under-served SMB segment with a bundled, scalable, AI-driven alternative.

Durable Demand: Strong. Local businesses will always need visibility and compliance.

Cash Flow Predictability: High due to subscriptions.

Scalability: High. Heavy automation minimizes marginal costs.

Dependence on tech trends? Yes, but leverages robust providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Trends).
